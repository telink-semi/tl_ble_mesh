 * @brief      This function is used to set swire read timeout tick.

 *             when the slave finds that the high level lasts longer than the previous low level time, it starts sending data. After sending 8 bits,
 *             it sends another unit of low level. The read operation time is the master sends one Bit and the slave sends nine bits.
 *             a bit allowance is added to the master and slave respectively. The final calculation formula is as follows:
 *             s_read_timeout_tick =   1000000*(1/master_clk*5*2 + 1/slave_clk*5*10)/(1/stimer_clk)
